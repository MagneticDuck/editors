# Editors

Text editors / IDEs are a huge part of any programmer's life; they present information in comprehendable ways, they let us touch that information with our keyboards and mice, and they complement the semantics of our language and patterns of our workflow. It's not a simple task however, and from its inherent subjective complexity arises the need to make user-side customization possible. Many things make up the customization of a particular editor for a particular programmer, from color schemes to code completion snippits to error checking integration to code style helpers... and I, for one, would like to have those set of things exactly equal on every machine I work on. This repository is my particular solution to that issue, using the flexibility and determinism of nix, the build system.
